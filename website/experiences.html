                    <p> My first job ever was in LCC English Summer Day Camps. I was 17 years old when I got team leader's position in the camps and I have been coming back to work there for 3 years now. While doing so, I got the chance to teach kids and teens English, since it was a requirement to speak only in English to expose kids to that sort of an invironment. Also, I was invovled in organizing the activities of the camp. After being a team leader for 2 years, in the summer of 2019, I got offered the coordinator's position in the camps. This meant that I was in charge of organizing and running the camps together with few other colleagues. Not only that, but it also meant that now I would be leading the team leaders and not only kids.</p>

                    <p> In the summer of 2018, for the month of August I worked as an assistant in Lithuanian Language and Culture Courses at LCC. I mostly helped the students with Lithuanian language homework, since it was their first encounter with the language. Also, as part of my job, I had to organize the cultural evening, as shown in the picture. On the weekends, together with the students and course instructors, we would travel to different parts of Lithuania. Overall, it was such a fun experience. I got to meet people from all around the world and help them learn more about Lithuanian language and culture. </p>

                <p> Since I am a full time student at LCC International University, I had a chance to get a job on campus. Since my freshman year I have been working as a receptionist. For my first academic year I worked at reception in the Neumann hall. For the summer, however, I trasferred to the main reception in DeFehr building. There, the job was more high-maintenance, meaning that I had to learn how to work with finances and a cashier, since most of the payments went through the front desk. Not only that, but the receptionists in DeFehr are considered to be the face of LCC, so profesionalism was one of the main requirements. After the summer, I got transferred back to Neumann hall front desk and that is where I am working at the moment. There, I still have to remain professional, but what makes it more interesting is that there I am surrounded by my fellow university students - the residents of the dorm. I often have to help them with everyday tasks in Lithuania or even LCC, since most of them are foreigners of freshman. This position is more than a job to me - it's my outlet to serve people. </p>
