                    <p> For me, the most important thing in my life is God and my faith. Whenever I tell people that I am a Christian, they get scared and think that I am your stereotypical and conservative Catholic, not that all of them are like that. However, I express my faith through love and respect for other people and the nature. I try my best to be a humble and loving person through what the Word of God has taught me. I want to build my live on faith, therefore, I feel like it is so important to share my worldview with others. </p>

                    <p> As part of my life as a Christian, I find ways to serve my community. For a few years I would volunteer in my church's camps as a team leader, where I would be sharing the Good News with kids. Later, I joined the same church's worship band. One thing you should know about me - I LOVE MUSIC. I cannot go a day without listening and singing along my favorite music. I have been like that ever since I was a small child and I got to express my love for music by going to arts school. There, I sang in a professional choir for almost 10 years. Now that I am in my sophomore year, I finally had enough courage to join a chapel band at LCC. In this way me and my fellow worshipers serve LCC community. </p>

                <p> LCC International University is my second home. I feel like studying here is only a small part of the overall experience. My heart and soul are in this place and it is a big part of who I am as a person. LCC community has shaped me and still is shaping me to be a better person. I feel like I have found the perfect study and community balance here. </p>

				<p> As for my studies, I am currently in my second year of studies at LCC, majoring in Contemporary Communication. The study program is so broad, yet it mainly focuses on relations with other people in business and every day world. Since LCC is so international, we are constantly are exposed to diverse cultures and worldviews, which makes people more aware and tolerant to others. Also, LCC is a liberal arts university, which means that students are not only limited to their majors. This also broadens my horizons and makes me appreciate my education even more. </p>

				<p> For me, the best way to spend my free time is by traveling to some of the most beautiful places in the world, especially, the mountains. I like to say that while I am in the mountains, my soul sings. And it really does, the wonders of nature fulfill my soul. I feel like I am that kind of a person who cannot stay put. New adventures, challenges and surprises do not scare me. Just like climbing the mountains, I seek to climb high through life. </p>
